# Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling in R
## In this project, I utilized a cross-sectional population survey of college students (N = 8,613 participants) to examine the extent to which broad psychopathology factors account for specific associations between emotional problems and suicideal ideation. Confirmatory factor models were estimated to identify the best structure of psychopathology and structural equation models were used to partition the variance between broad and specific effects.
## The first stage involved constructing the broad internalizing latent dimensions from observered symptom measures using using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In factor-analytics language, this involves generating the measurement model.
## The second step in the analysis involved regressing psychopathology variables on suicideal ideation. To answer our question about potential etiological pathways across multiple levels of the dimensional hierarchy, we estimated total, direct, and indirect effects of suicideal ideation on psychopathology outcomes (i.e., symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder; distress and fear; and internalizing) one at a time.
